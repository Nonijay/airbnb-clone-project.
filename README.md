### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
  - It helps in keeping us organised and streamlined
  - With a clear design, the chances of errors during development reduce.
  - it increases focus and productivity
  - A detailed design phase means everyone knows what to expect
  - Developers have a clear roadmap
  - stakeholders know the final product's look and feel
  - It's easier to follow a set plan than to make things up along the way
